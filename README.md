ðŸ“š Java Arrays â€“ Overview
ðŸ”¢ What is an Array in Java?
An array in Java is a container object that holds a fixed number of elements of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

ðŸ§± Key Features
Fixed Size: Once created, the size of the array cannot be changed.

Indexed Access: Elements are accessed using indices (starting from 0).

Homogeneous Elements: Stores elements of the same data type.

Stored in Contiguous Memory: Improves performance for certain operations.
